# News Sentiment API (Model Container)

### Note:
*To productionize the Sentiment API (continuous data update), the following repositories must be installed and Docker containers initialized in order.*

1. [Data: polygoniio-news-sentiment-data](https://github.com/tearheart/polygonio-news-sentiment-data)
2. [Model: polygoniio-news-sentiment-model](https://github.com/tearheart/polygonio-news-sentiment-model)
3. [API: polygoniio-news-sentiment-api](https://github.com/tearheart/polygonio-news-sentiment-api)

## Steps to install and operate Docker container locally
Clone the GitHub repository `polygonio-news-sentiment-model`.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tearheart/polygonio-news-sentiment-model
```

Move into new directory `polygonio-news-sentiment-model`.
``` bash
cd polygonio-news-sentiment-model
```

***Optional: If you want to tinker with the code.  Create new virtual environment of your choce.  Here are the instructions for Conda.
``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --force
```

Add PolygonIO API key to local environment.  Free PolygonIO account can be created [here](https://polygon.io/).
``` bash
export POLYGON_API_KEY=<add PolygonIO key here>
```

Build Docker container locally.  Please inspect the `Makefile` to understand what is going on behind the scenes.
``` bash
make local-build
```

Run Docker container locally. This step requires the use of a PolygonIO API key in the form of an environment variable.
``` bash
make local-run
```

Access to the API interface, the output of `make local-run` should output a link like `http://0.0.0.0:8080` or `http://localhost:8080`.  Click on the link and explore the API interface.  Click on the `sentiment` link, then click `Try Out` and you will be able to test the FinBERT sentiment model.

## Steps to create Docker image, push image, and create Docker container via GCP Cloud Shell
Create and authorize new GCP Cloud Shell
``` bash
gcloud auth list
```

Clone the GitHub repository `polygonio-news-sentiment-model`.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tearheart/polygonio-news-sentiment-model
```

Move into new directory `polygonio-news-sentiment-model`.
``` bash
cd polygonio-news-sentiment-model
```

Create `docker build` image to be pushed to GCP Artifact Registry.
``` bash
make gcp-build
```

Push Docker image to GCP Artifact Registry.
``` bash
make gcp-push
```

Build and run Docker container in GCP Cloud Run.
``` bash
make gcp-run
```

Go to GCP Cloud Run and find related container.  The name of the container will have the following form: 

```<gcp zone>-docker.pkg.dev/<project name>/<repository name>/<container name>```
